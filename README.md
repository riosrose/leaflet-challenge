UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 15 

CHALLENGE 15 DATASERT BACKGROUND:The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

CHALLENGE PURPOSE : In this challenge, a visualizatioin of USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Code source location within your repo. 

Files stored in the repo are to create a comprehensive data visualization project that used : 
  - HTML for structure, JavaScript for interactivity, and CSS for styling.
* <edit> HTML File: This file contains the structure of the webpage where the data visualization will be displayed. It includes the necessary HTML elements, such as <html>, <head>, <body>, and may link to external CSS and JavaScript files.
* <edit> JavaScript File(s): These files contain the JavaScript code responsible for fetching, processing, and visualizing the data. JavaScript files may include libraries like D3.js, Leaflet.js, Chart.js, etc., depending on the requirements of the visualization.
* <edit> CSS File(s): While not explicitly mentioned, CSS files are often used to style the HTML elements and enhance the visual presentation of the data visualization.
* <edit> Data File(s): These files contain the actual data that will be visualized. Data files can be in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or even fetched from an API.
